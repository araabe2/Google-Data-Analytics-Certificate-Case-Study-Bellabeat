## Guiding questions:
**What is the problem you are trying to solve?**
 - Understand user trends within the field of smart devices to provide advice towards further marketing efforts for one or more Bellabeat products.
 - Select **[Bellabeat Spring]**.  How can current trends in smart device usage inform our business strategy for **[Bellabeat Spring]**?  In so discovering, we can tailor our marketing strategy for this product to better match with our desired consumers needs and to reach out to unreached consumers who would partake in the product.

**How can your insights drive business decisions?**
 - Under-utilized or unreached markets could require different advertisement techniques to reach them.
 - Product development focus could be shifted away from existing products towards a trendier topic within the market, or inform development of new products. (This would be outside the scope of this business task.)
 - Understanding user habits can lead to advertisement content being shifted to more closely relate to usage and prevent the company from feeling out-of-touch, maintaining public image.
 - Allocation of server resources can be altered to provide a cleaner user experience at times of peak usage.
 - Decisions about ad timing can be tuned to provide more clickthrough.
 - Influences popular with the target demographic can be sponsored to raise awareness of the product and its benefits.

## Business task:
 - Using data gathered from non-Bellabeat devices, discover trends and insights to inform Bellabeat marketing strategies.
 - Apply high-level trends and insights to a specific product, Bellabeat Spring, to provide specific suggestions for marketing efforts.
