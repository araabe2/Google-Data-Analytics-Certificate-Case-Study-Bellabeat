## ASK 
**Purpose:** Understand the question being asked \
**Deliverable:** A clear summary of the business task

### Guiding questions:
What is the problem you are trying to solve?
 - Understand user trends within the field of smart devices to provide advice towards further marketting efforts for one or more Bellabeat products.
 - Select **[Bellabeat Spring]**.  How can current trends in smart device usage inform our business strategy for **[Bellabeat Spring]**?  In so discovering, we can tailor our marketting strategy for this product to better match with our desired consumers needs and to reach out to unreached consumers who would partake in the product.

How can your insights drive business decisions?
 - Under-utilized or unreached markets could require different advertisement techniques to reach them.
 - Product development focus could be shifted away from existing products towards a trendier topic within the market, or inform development of new products. (This would be outside the scope of this business task.)
 - Understanding user habits can lead to advertisement content being shifted to more closely relate to usage and prevent the company from feeling out-of-touch, maintaining public image.
 - Allocation of server resources can be altered to provide a cleaner user experience at times of peak usage.
 - Decisions about ad timing can be tuned to provide more clickthrough.
 - Influences popular with the target demographic can be sponsored to raise awareness of the product and its benefits.
